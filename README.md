## Dataset

> The Prosper Loan Data contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables including loan amount, interest rate, current loan status, borrower income, and many more. This data was pulled from Prosper.com, a peer-to-peer lending platform, in 2009. 

>The Prosper Loan Data is a great resource for anyone interested in peer-to-peer lending or looking to study the effects of different loan characteristics on loan performance. The data can be used to build models that predict loan default or loss, and can also be used to study the effects of different loan features on borrower behavior.


## Summary of Findings

>Based on the above data, it appears that loans with higher interest rates are more likely to be delinquent. This is likely due to the fact that borrowers with higher interest rates are generally considered to be higher risk. Additionally, loans with shorter terms are also more likely to be delinquent. This is likely due to the fact that borrowers with shorter terms have less time to repay their loans.

>The above data also shows that loans with higher interest rates are more likely to be charged off. This is likely due to the fact that borrowers with higher interest rates are generally considered to be higher risk. Additionally, loans with shorter terms are also more likely to be charged off. This is likely due to the fact that borrowers with shorter terms have less time to repay their loans.

>Based on the above data, it is clear that loans with higher interest rates and shorter terms are more likely to be delinquent or charged off. Borrowers with higher interest rates are generally considered to be higher risk, and loans with shorter terms have less time to be repaid. Therefore, it is important for lenders to carefully consider the interest rate and term of a loan before extending credit to a borrower.


## Key Insights for Presentation


> It is observed that most borrowers are not included in the known occupations. For known ocupations, most borrowers tend to be professional borrowers.

> No pair of individuals exhibits a positive relationship. Given that a higher AvailableBankcardCredit has a better credit score, it makes logical. The relationship between BorrowerAPR and ProsperScore is unfavorable since borrowers with lower scores are more likely to have higher APRs. Similar to this, a better CreditScore indicates more reliable borrowers, which results in a reduced APR.
